# Code Refactor Starter Code

## The Challenge

To clean up the code for the following website and to make it easy to read and function correctly.

## What changes I made

- Added semantic HTML elements to the index.
    ~ Added a "header" and a "footer" than replaced the classes in the CSS with the semantic name.
    ~ Added "aside" to the side section of the website.
- Added an "id" to the "search-engine-optimization to allow the button to work.
- Added "alt"'s to all of the images with descriptions.
- Replaced the appropriate "div" with semantic HTML elements.
    ~ sections, articles
- Change the "title" to a more suitable and descriptive name.
